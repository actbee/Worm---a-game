Use light to lead the worm eating as more balls as possible, avoiding the 
square and finally get the highest score!

Button List:

2: to open/close drag effect
3: to choose game mode: 
    EASY: control the worm's head location directly   
    MIDDLE: control the worm's velocity
    HARD: control the worm's acceleration
W/w: show camera graphic
S/s: hide camera graphic 
F/f: stop control (and the worm move freedomly)
